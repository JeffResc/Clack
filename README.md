## Questions
*Draw a single class diagram connecting all data classes, the ClackClient  class, and the ClackServer class. Feel free to either draw using a program such as Microsoft Visio (or even PowerPoint or Paint if you can manage it), or to use penand-paper and take a photo. Your diagram drawn either digitally or drawn using pen-and-paper and photographed should be copy-pasted into the report.*

*In your test classes, what happens if you provide a negative value for a port number, or a null value for a user? How do you think you can fix these issues?*

**Needs to be finished.**
